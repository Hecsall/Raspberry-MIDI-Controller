## Raspberry Pi Zero - MIDI Controller

This is a project i did trying to make a midi controller with a Raspberry Pi Zero in "Gadget Mode" (so a standalone device that's plug-and-play with a single USB cable just like every other MIDI controller)

For this to work i user the g_midi module, RPI.gpio and python-rtmidi.

First follow this guide to setup the Raspberry to work as MIDI gadget, and to create a "MIDI Device" to use as MIDI channel for the output MIDI signals.

(also i downloaded that PDF and uploaded in this git in the "other" folder, just to be sure not to lose it if the link goes down)

Instructions Work in progress... I'll finish this readme as soon as i can
