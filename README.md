# Raspberry Pi Zero - MIDI Controller

This is a project i did to make a midi controller using a Raspberry Pi Zero in "Gadget Mode" (a standalone device that's plug-and-play with a single USB cable just like every other MIDI controller).\
The script is still work in progress, at the moment i made only the "Sustain" button, but i'm planning to enhance it with more functions.

For this to work i user the g_midi module, RPI.gpio and python-rtmidi.

First follow this guide to setup the Raspberry to work as MIDI gadget, and to create a "MIDI Device" that we will use to output MIDI signals.\
[Raspberry as MIDI Device Guide](https://ixdlab.itu.dk/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2017/10/Setting-Up-Raspberry-Pi-for-MIDI.pdf)\
(also i downloaded that PDF and uploaded in this git in the "other" folder, just to be sure not to lose it if the link goes down)

Instructions Work in progress... I'll finish this readme as soon as i can.
